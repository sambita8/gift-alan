           <p> this is one of my favourite songs to ever exist. every time i get sad and feel low, i listen to this.
            it makes me even more so depressed but its okay since i can cry and get it off my chest?

            <div class="para" id="grace"> <h3> LION'S DEN</h3>
            <P>i wanted to tell you that things are hard i know, everyone goes through it but we are strong oke? 
            people might walk all over you and still have a lot to say against you but i just want you to remember
            that you can always come running to me and if you want I'LL RUN THEM OVER WITH BULLDOZERS. 
            honestly speaking, even i myself am not that strong and all. i get socially awkward 
            everywhere and one of the very few people i dont mind being loud around or stuttering and
            jumbling my pronounciation , its you. and i am so so so thankful for you.At times when i 
            dont feel anything and sit on the floor i cry out to you, cause you mean that much to me and
            i am so so so grateful for it. I know we both are going to college and will be pretty busy 
            but you are and always will be my BESTEST BEST FRIEND. (too much cringe but accept kariyo.)
