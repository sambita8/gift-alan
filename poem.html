    <main>
        <h4> For your 17th Bday</h4> <br>
  <p><div id="b17"> 
    Lay on my lap when you seek comfort 
    Hide behind me when you get scared 
    Hug me tight, when you wanna cry 
    Send me notes 'bout who's annoying 
    But never who tried to love you more 
    Cause no one can, hun 
    Record and send songs as if we're lovers
    Let's fool them together babe 
    And even if you get a real romeo
    Never forget, he'll never be able to love you more than me, 
    Cause no one can do so... 
    Rant to me on how you got scolded 
    So that i can keep you warm and close to my heart, 
    All cute and happy like you always are 
    As they won't understand you and us 
    Cause no one can... 
    Tell me Who all hurt you bad and did you wrong 
    So that i can keep you safe 
    But never look back at them 
    Cause they'll try to bring you down, princess 
    Show them how to wear the crown 
    Cause no one can do it like you </div><div>
    Everything of ours has ever been so perfect 
    None of us have ever been hurt 
    Everyone of us have been ever so happy
    Smiling at each other, at all times of the day
    Just cause of you and us... 
    Stick with me forever 
    Caress my scars, wipe my tears, 
    Help me carry these burdens
    Tell me that i can do it
    Cause no one can do it like you... 
    Just stay and Give me reasons to smile wide 
    All the time 
    Why not to cry 
    And why wasting time after them, is such a useless crime 
    
    You are my favorite song
    To which I dance everyday 
    With just happy memories, 
    Creating more of them, every moment
    This song is to let you know why
    I'll stay ever forever
    And later tell everyone about our happily ever after 
     </div> </p> <br>
     <p class="note"> its giving toxic obsessive infatuated love but made it platonic encouraging grateful. mera wala toxic you got to accept  &#9755; &#9754;  </p>

<h4>  For your 18th Bday</h4>
        <p>
            <div >the way you are so far away 
Still when I sit in my room as I say 
I see you in front of me 
Telling me it'll all be okay 
Telling me you'll never leave 
Giving me that hug, no one ever did 
Singing to my heart in a way no one ever could 
Hearing my life song as if it's your own 
Holding my hand, pulling me forward into that warmth 
Is something only you did ....

You don't know how grateful I am 
You don't know that the love i would die for 
Is the one that you have for me 
You don't know how dear you are 
The way your face pops up everytime I have tea to share 
Or everytime my face lits up when ever your name comes around me.... 
The way any text of yours brightens my day 
Be it your voice notes or some jumbled letters with no meaning
It is so much more meaningful to me....  </div> <div id="b18">

You are so fucking special to me 
The first person I have opened upto 
The first person who is seeing my vulnerable side, the side that I promised no one ever would know about 
The first person who I think about when I open my phone 
The first person whom I hugged, whom I wish to hug when I have a bad day 
The first person for whose house party I threw a fit at home 
The first person whom I care about more than my studies 
The first person that i thought about my future with
Ticking off things from our so called bucket list
Bunking college and going to see each other, even if it's different cities.... 

The first and only person I would never wish for them to leave is YOU.

<h4> the monster we all know of </h4>
 <p><div>
    it comes back 
    comes baack every night 
    to fuck with me and my harmless thoughts
    it can't bear to see me sleeping
    so, wakes me up with those thoughts 
    thoughts that have now turned into wishes 
    my utmost duties that i wanna fulfill
    and that's to disappear without a trace from this tragic place 
    with no dead ends, no beginings, 
    just a roadway that keeps on going 
    bringing me back to the same point every year once a day 
    that pit which lies behind the graveyard 
    that pit where it resides and waits for me all the time
    the pit of my darkest fears 
    the pit that brings out the worst in me 
    the monster that sleeps within 
    it means no harm or so they say</div><div id="monster">
    but wakes up with a mouth never so horrendous 
    a soul never so cruel
    a mind never so dark 
    a person who couldnt be more senseless yet insensitive 
    is it what this has to be?
    where's that guardian angel of mine?
    where's anyone?
    what am i supposed to do?
    go along with those thoughts
    succumb to evil
    or tear the evil apart by crushing its soul 
    with the horrifying words
    that are screaming inside my head,
    waiting to be said out loud?
    or should i just lie low?
    without any human contact?
   
 </div></p> <br>
 <p class="note"> hmm we all have anxiety that keeps us up at night and that fear about what if i am a bad person? since a lot of people point their fingers at us telling "how have you come to this"...so i just wanted you to know that YOU are not a bad person, YOU can NEVER be one even if you wanted to (that's on how dumb you are) lol....and i just wanted you to know that..

<h4> in hopes of Better Days</h4>

<p><div> 
whats gonna happen 
if i ever do reveal my age old scars?
the disgusting marks that the tears left by
those marks which prove my struggles?
but can i actually call my past a struggle?
arent they the proof of my incapbility
the proof of of my ill luck ?
can i just please count em out as "bad memories" "misfortunes"
or "a failing giveaway" that came my way 
can i hope for a better day 
where i'll stay up till 8
and not cry the entire night to mydearest pillow...
a better day 
where i'll look people in the eye 
and not make jokes about myself, my self esteem 
a better day 
when everything will be going right
with a content heart and no such faults...
the "better days" concept is the original will of people
to live a happy life 
a life where they want to live with a hold of superiority
a superior power that's even over God's.
but why is mine so different? </div><div id="xx">
why does "my better days" make upsomething so unrelated yet familiar?
better days where 
i crave to be looked at with content 
but not in a pitiful gaze
someplace to belong, but not be found
someone to long for, and them wishing it back to me
somewhere i'll be present with everyone i adore 
but only as an insignificant shadow 
lying in the back of my room 
in my own world that consists of you but not much of me 
when i'll be strong enough on my own
letting go of the fact that i am nothing 
even if i ever conquer everything??
will that "better day " ever come to life?
will it come by say "hi"
giving its alll in making it special 
and love me as those scars still do?
or will it fade away into nothingness as those
valuable yet empty promises i was sworn to?
</div></p> <br>

<p class="note">its okay to sometimes have small goals and ambitions (mera khud ka hai) and anxiety hota hai when we see everyone around us talking about big things but its okay to take baby steps ig? and do as much as we can...

<h4>Bits and pieces about us</h4>
<p> <div>
her heart
kinda a garden 
that holds the dearest flower i was looking for 
a mesmerizing place 
that held me dear
</div>
<div>
my heart kinda stained 
kinda in bits and pieces 
wrecked over completely 
yet she holds it 
with all the care i wished for 
</div> <hr>
<div>
giving you a smile 
for our forever 
so that it stays there 
comforting your heart 
for the coming time
</div>

with your sweet heart 
holding myself strong 
until the next time we meet
